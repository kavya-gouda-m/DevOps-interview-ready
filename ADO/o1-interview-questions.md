### How would you design an enterprise-scale Azure DevOps architecture for multiple business units?

Goals: scalability, security, governance, autonomy per BU, cost control, reusability.

High-level design:

-   Option A: Single organization with multiple projects — best for centralized governance and cross-team collaboration.
-   Option B: Multiple organizations (one per large BU) — if strict data/isolation/regulatory needs exist.

Projects & Repos:
- One project per product or BU; use repo-per-service with branch policies (PR reviews, build validation).

Pipeline strategy:
- Use YAML pipelines in repos (pipeline-as-code). Provide centralized templates (YAML templates) stored in a shared repo or artifact that teams import.

Agent Pools:
- Shared hosted pools for common workloads; dedicated self-hosted pools for special requirements (compliance, high IO). Use VMSS to scale self-hosted agents.

Artifacts & Package Feeds:
- Central Azure Artifacts feed per organization with upstream sources, or feed-per-BU for isolation.

Secrets & Identity:
- Central Key Vault per environment (dev/test/stage/prod) with RBAC. Use service connections and Managed Identity where possible.

Access Control & Governance: 
- Enforce branch policies, PR approvals, and enforce security checks via pipeline gates.
- Use Azure AD groups and Azure DevOps groups for RBAC; least privilege for service connections.
- Enforce policy as code (ARM/Bicep/Terraform) for infra provisioning.

Environments & Approvals:
- Define environments in Azure DevOps (e.g., dev, qa, stage, prod) with approvals & checks (e.g., business approvers, security scans).

Security & Compliance:
- Integrate SAST/DAST (SonarQube, Dependabot, Trivy) into pipelines; require passing policies for prod gate.

Secrets scanning in CI: 
- supply chain security checks (signed packages, SBOM).

Observability & Telemetry:
- Central logging/monitoring (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, App Insights) with shared dashboards. Pipeline metrics and cost reporting.

Templates & Libraries:
- Central “DevOps Platform” team delivers YAML templates, reusable tasks, scripts, and CI/CD modules (immutable and versioned).

Self-service & Onboarding: 
- Provide starter templates, pipeline-as-code samples, and a catalog of approved service connections/agent pools.

Disaster Recovery & Backups: 
- Back up pipeline definitions, export key configurations, and have DR plan for agent pools and artifact feeds.

###  If a deployment is failing in production, how would you troubleshoot and recover quickly using Azure DevOps?

Immediate goal: Restore service quickly while preserving data integrity — then do root-cause analysis.

Cost & Quota Management:  
- Tag resources by BU, monitor pipeline minutes (hosted agents), and enforce quotas.
