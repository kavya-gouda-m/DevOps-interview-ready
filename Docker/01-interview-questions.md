1. What are "distroless" images, and what are their pros and cons?
   
    Distroless images (popularized by Google) are base images containing only your application and its runtime dependencies. They do not include package managers, shells, or other standard Linux utilities found in typical distributions like Debian or Alpine.
    Pros:
    - Minimal Attack Surface: Significantly reduced number of packages and binaries lowers the chance of vulnerabilities.
    - Smaller Size: Often smaller than even Alpine-based images.
    Cons:
    - Debugging Difficulty: Lack of a shell makes debugging (docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh) impossible. You might need separate debug versions of images or rely entirely on application logs and external monitoring.
    - Missing Utilities: Common tools like ls, ps, curl, ping are absent, which can complicate troubleshooting or certain application functionalities that rely on shelling out.
  
2. What is a Dockerfile?
   
   A Dockerfile is a text script that contains a series of instructions on how to build a specific Docker image. Docker reads these instructions sequentially, executing them to assemble the final image layer by layer. It automates the process of creating container images
4. What is the purpose of the FROM instruction?
   
   The FROM instruction initializes a new build stage and sets the base image for subsequent instructions. Every Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction (except for ARG preceding the first FROM). It specifies the parent image from which you are building. E.g., FROM ubuntu:22.04, FROM python:3.9-slim.  
6. Explain the RUN instruction.
   
   The RUN instruction executes commands during the image build process. Each RUN command executes in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results. It's primarily used for installing packages, compiling code, creating directories, or any other setup needed within the image itself. E.g., RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
   
8. What's the difference between COPY and ADD?
   
   Both COPY and ADD are used to get files from the host machine (or another location) into the container image's filesystem
   COPY: Simpler. It copies local files or directories from the build context into the image. E.g., COPY ./app /app.
   ADD: More feature-rich, but potentially riskier. It can do everything COPY does, but it can also copy from URLs and automatically extract compressed archives (like tar, gzip, bzip2) if the source is a recognized archive format.
   Best Practice: Prefer COPY unless you specifically need the URL download or auto-extraction feature of ADD, as COPY is more explicit and predictable. Auto-extraction can be problematic if the archive contains unexpected paths or files
10. What does the WORKDIR instruction do?
    
    The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any subsequent RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions in the Dockerfile. If the directory doesn't exist, WORKDIR will create it. Using WORKDIR is preferable to chaining RUN cd ... commands. E.g., WORKDIR /app
12. What is the purpose of the EXPOSE instruction?
    
    EXPOSE informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It acts primarily as documentation between the image builder and the person running the container about which ports are intended to be published. It does not actually publish the port. You still need to use the -p or -P flag with docker run to map the port to the host. E.g., EXPOSE 8080.
14. How does Docker build images in layers, and why is this important?
    
    Docker images are built layer by layer. Each instruction in the Dockerfile (like RUN, COPY, ADD) typically creates a new layer. Each layer is essentially a set of filesystem changes compared to the layer below it. These layers are read-only
    Importance:
      Caching: Docker caches layers. If a layer's instruction and its inputs haven't changed since the last build, Docker reuses the cached layer instead of re-executing the instruction, speeding up builds significantly.
      Efficiency: Layers can be shared between images. If multiple images share the same base layers (e.g., the Ubuntu OS layers), they only need to be stored and downloaded once.
  
16. How can you optimize Dockerfile caching?
    
    1.  Order Matters: Place instructions that change less frequently (like FROM, apt-get update/install) earlier in the Dockerfile, and instructions that change more frequently (like COPYing source code) later.
    2.  Be Specific with COPY/ADD: Only copy what's necessary. A change in any file within the copied directory invalidates the cache for that COPY step and all subsequent steps. Use .dockerignore.
    3.  Combine RUN Commands: Chain related RUN commands using && to reduce the number of layers. For example, combine apt-get update and apt-get install in one RUN instruction. Also, clean up temporary files within the same RUN command (e.g., rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) to avoid bloating intermediate layers.
    4.  Use Specific Base Image Tags: Avoid using :latest. Use specific tags (e.g., ubuntu:22.04, python:3.9.12-slim) to ensure predictable builds and avoid unintended base image updates that break caching.
    5.  Utilize BuildKit Cache Mounts: (Advanced) Use --mount=type=cache for more sophisticated caching of package managers or build tools.
      
18. What is the build context? How does .dockerignore relate to it?
    
    Build Context: When you run docker build, the Docker client sends the specified directory (or URL) – the build context – to the Docker daemon. By default, this is the directory containing the Dockerfile. The daemon needs this context to access any files specified in COPY or ADD instructions.

    .dockerignore: This file, placed in the root of the build context, lists files or directories to exclude from being sent to the daemon.
    This is crucial for:
        Speed: Prevents sending large, unnecessary files (like .git, build artifacts, local dependencies, logs) to the daemon, speeding up the build start time.
        Caching: Avoids unnecessarily breaking the cache if irrelevant files change.
        Security: Prevents accidentally copying sensitive files (like credentials) into the image
    
20. Explain ARG and ENV. What's the difference?
    
    ARG: Defines build-time variables. These variables are only available during the image build process (from the ARG line onwards) and are not available in the running container by default. They can be set using the --build-arg flag during docker build. You can declare ARGs before the first FROM
    ENV: Sets persistent environment variables. These variables are available both during the build (from the ENV line onwards) and inside the running container. They can be set using ENV key=value or ENV key value in the Dockerfile
    ARG is for build-time customization, ENV is for runtime environment configuration (though also usable at build time after definition). You can use an ARG to set the value of an EN
    
22. How can you minimize the attack surface of a Docker image using the Dockerfile?
    
    1. Use Minimal Base Images: Start with small, trusted base images like alpine, debian-slim, or distroless. These contain fewer packages and libraries, reducing potential vulnerabilities.
    2. Multi-Stage Builds: Discard build tools, compilers, and development dependencies in the final stage.
    3. Install Only Necessary Packages: Avoid installing unnecessary tools or libraries.
    4. Remove Unused Dependencies/Files: Clean up package manager caches (apt-get clean, rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) and temporary files within the same RUN layer they were created.
    5. Run as Non-Root User: Use the USER instruction to switch to a less privileged user before executing the main application (CMD/ENTRYPOINT).
    6. Don't Leak Secrets: Use BuildKit secret mounts instead of ARG or ENV for sensitive data.
    7. Scan Images: Integrate security scanners (like Trivy, Clair, Snyk) into your CI/CD pipeline to check for known vulnerabilities in image layers.
   
24.  How and why would you use the USER instruction?
    The USER instruction sets the username (or UID) and optionally the group (or GID) to use when running subsequent RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT commands.
    Why: For security (Principle of Least Privilege). Running containers as the root user (the default) is risky. If an attacker compromises the application inside the container, they gain root access within the container, potentially leading to further exploitation. By creating a dedicated non-root user and group and switching to that user with the USER instruction before the CMD or ENTRYPOINT, you limit the potential damage an attacker can do.
    How:
```
      # Create group and user first (syntax might vary based on base image)
      RUN groupadd -r myapp && useradd -r -g myapp myapp
      # ... other setup ...
      # Switch to the non-root user
      USER myapp
      # Subsequent commands run as 'myapp'
      CMD ["./my-application"]
```
25. Can you use an intermediate stage from a multi-stage build as a base for another stage later in the same Dockerfile?
    
    Yes. You can name stages using AS <stage_name> and then use that name in a subsequent FROM instruction within the same Dockerfile. For example, you might have a common base stage, then a builder stage FROM base, and finally a tester stage also FROM base but perhaps copying different artifacts or adding testing tools. Your final image might then be FROM base again, copying artifacts from builder.

26. How do ARG instructions interact with the build cache?
    
    Declaring an ARG (ARG USER) doesn't affect the cache. However, if an ARG value used in a subsequent instruction (like RUN, COPY, ENV) changes between builds (docker build --build-arg USER=test), it will invalidate the cache from that point forward, just like any other change to an instruction. If an ARG is declared before the first FROM, a change to its value will invalidate the cache for all stages that use it.
    
28. How does the HEALTHCHECK instruction work?

    HEALTHCHECK tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working (i.e., "healthy"). Docker can then use this status to manage the container (e.g., a container orchestrator might restart an unhealthy container).
    How: You define a command that runs periodically inside the container. The command's exit status indicates health: 0=healthy, 1=unhealthy. Non-zero can also be used, but 1 is standard for unhealthy. Options control the interval, timeout, start period, and retries.
```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```
  This checks http://localhost:8080/health every 5 minutes. If curl fails (non-zero exit code), the container is marked unhealthy after the specified retries.

  
29. How does changing metadata instructions like LABEL, MAINTAINER, EXPOSE, ENV, VOLUME, USER, WORKDIR, ONBUILD, STOPSIGNAL, HEALTHCHECK, SHELL affect build caching?
    Instructions that only modify image metadata (like LABEL, MAINTAINER, EXPOSE, ENV, VOLUME, USER, WORKDIR, ONBUILD, STOPSIGNAL, HEALTHCHECK, SHELL) generally do not invalidate the build cache for subsequent instructions like RUN, COPY, or ADD. Docker typically creates a "cheap" layer for these metadata changes.
    However, changing an ENV or ARG value might invalidate the cache for subsequent RUN commands if that RUN command utilizes the variable (especially in shell form). Changing the USER will affect subsequent RUN commands as they execute as that user.

30. What is the "PID 1" problem in containers, and how does the exec form of ENTRYPOINT/CMD help?

    In Unix-like systems, the process with Process ID (PID) 1 is special (the init process). It's responsible for adopting orphaned child processes and handling signals (like SIGTERM for graceful shutdown) correctly.
    The Problem: If your container's main process runs using the shell form (ENTRYPOINT /app/run.sh), the shell (/bin/sh -c) becomes PID 1. Often, these shells don't handle signals properly or forward them to the actual application process started by the script. This means docker stop might time out and forcefully kill (SIGKILL) your container instead of allowing a graceful shutdown
    The Solution: Using the exec form (ENTRYPOINT ["/app/run.py"] or ENTRYPOINT ["/app/run.sh"]) makes your application executable PID 1 directly. If your application is written to handle signals like SIGTERM correctly, it will receive them and can shut down gracefully. If the entrypoint must be a script, ensure the script uses exec at the end (e.g., exec /app/run.py "$@") to replace the shell process with the application process, making the application PID 1. Alternatively, use a minimal init system like tini or dumb-init as the ENTRYPOINT to handle signals and manage processes correctly.
