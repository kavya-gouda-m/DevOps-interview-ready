### How would you design auto-scaling for 50M+ concurrent viewers across multiple K8s clusters without over-provisioning?

Handling 50M+ concurrent viewers requires scaling at three distinct levels: the pods, the nodes, and the clusters themselves.

Layer 1: Pod Scaling (The Application) - HPA & KEDA

This is about scaling the application replicas. A standard Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory is a starting point, but it's too reactive for this scale and leads to over-provisioning.
- The Solution: We'll primarily use KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling). KEDA is superior here because it can scale based on metrics that directly reflect user load, not just lagging indicators like CPU.
- Metrics to Scale On:
  - Concurrent Connections: For a video streaming or websocket-based service, this is the most accurate metric. We can pull this from a message queue (like Kafka topic lag), a Redis pub/sub channel, or directly from a Prometheus query scraping our ingress controllers or application instances.
  - Requests Per Second (RPS): A good metric for API gateways or microservices handling session management.
  - Queue Depth: If viewers' requests are processed through a queue, the number of messages in the queue is a perfect signal of incoming load.
 
- Key Benefit: KEDA allows for scaling to zero. If there are no active viewers in a specific region, we can scale the pods down to zero, eliminating costs. When the first request comes in, KEDA scales it back up.

Layer 2: Node Scaling (The Infrastructure) - Karpenter

This layer ensures we have enough underlying VM capacity for our pods to run on. The default Cluster Autoscaler is good, but for massive, rapid scaling, it can be slow.

- The Solution: We'll use Karpenter. It's an open-source, high-performance cluster autoscaler built by AWS that works on any cloud.
- Why karpenter is better
  - Speed: Instead of waiting for a pod to be unschedulable and then slowly provisioning a node from a pre-defined group, Karpenter watches for unschedulable pods and provisions the perfectly-sized node just-in-time, often in under a minute.
  - Flexibility & Cost Savings: It's not tied to rigid node groups. We can define provisioners that allow Karpenter to choose from a wide range of instance types. This is where we achieve huge cost savings by heavily prioritizing Spot Instances (or Preemptible VMs on GCP) for our stateless workloads, with a fallback to On-Demand instances only when necessary.
  - Consolidation: Karpenter actively works to de-provision nodes when they are underutilized, efficiently packing pods onto existing nodes to reduce waste

Layer 3: Global Traffic Management

With multiple Kubernetes clusters, likely across different geographic regions, we need an intelligent way to distribute the 50 million viewers.
- CDN (Content Delivery Network): This is the first line of defense. A CDN like Cloudflare, Fastly, or AWS CloudFront will serve all static content and, crucially, cache video segments close to the users, dramatically reducing the load on our origin clusters.

- GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing): We'll use a DNS-based GSLB service (e.g., AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS). This will direct users to the healthiest and nearest Kubernetes cluster based on:
  - Geo-proximity Routing: Send users to the closest regional cluster (e.g., a user in Germany gets routed to eu-central-1).
  - Latency-based Routing: Route users to the region with the lowest latency for them.
  - Health Checks: The GSLB will continuously monitor the health of each cluster's ingress points. If a cluster becomes overloaded or unhealthy, it will be automatically removed from the rotation.
